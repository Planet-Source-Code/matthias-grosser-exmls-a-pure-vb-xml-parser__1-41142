## eXMLs \- a pure VB XML parser


</div>

### Description

If you always wanted to use XML storage in your projects, but the overhead of linking to MSXML deterred you from doing so, try this null-dependency library.

Full VB5 sources are included, demonstrating some neat OOP techniques. Supports CDATA, DOCTYPE and comment directives as well as full UTF-8 encoding.

You may use this code for _non-commercial_ purposes as you like, as long as you credit its usage. Never ever suppose it being completely free of bugs. On discovering any, please mail them to pluto@brain-killer.org.
 
### More Info
 
You need to set your IDE error handling options to "unhandled errors only" in order for this to work. Otherwise, the errors won't be forwarded up the class hierarchy and you'll get a err break.
